# Player Scouting & Goal-Scorer Analysis Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I took on the role of a **scout/player analyst** for Arsenal Football Club, using data to identify **potential goal-scorer signings** from across Europe. By comparing Arsenal's top scorer to other teams in the English Premier League (EPL) and analyzing **young, efficient goal-scorers** from top European leagues, I created a data-driven shortlist for Arsenal's future transfers.

## Featured Skills

- 📊 **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**: Data wrangling, analysis, and visualization
- 📈 **Statistical Analysis**: Composite metrics, rankings, efficiency
- ✨ **Feature Engineering**: Custom KPIs (non-PK %, minutes/goal)
- 🔬 **Scouting Insights**: Multi-league player evaluation
- 🔍 **Data Validation & Cleaning**: Null checks, targeted filtering

## Project Structure

- **goal-scorers-for-arsenal.ipynb**: Full project code with analysis and markdown
- **Non-Technical Summary.pdf**: One-page, executive-level findings for stakeholders

## Key Findings

- 🌐 Arsenal lacks a singular scoring threat compared to EPL rivals; Kai Havertz had 9 goals vs. Salah (23), Haaland (19), and Wood (18)
- 🏆 Identified 3 top young prospects (outside England) based on composite goal metrics: Mateo Retegui (Atalanta), Moise Kean (Fiorentina), Jonathan Burkardt (Mainz)

## Business Impact

By targeting **young, efficient scorers** from other leagues, Arsenal can close the scoring gap and compete more effectively for future titles. This analysis supports **data-driven transfer decisions** and **scouting efficiency**.
